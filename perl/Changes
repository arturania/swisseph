Revision history for Perl extension SwissEph.

First created on 3 April 2009, with Swiss Ephemeris 1.76.

Updated on 27 January 2011:
- Function swe_utc_time_zone() added for Swiss Ephemeris 1.77
- Delta t updated
- Fixed stars: algorithm in swe_fixstar() was improved, new input file sefstars.txt was created

Updated on 7 September 2012:
- Precession algorithm was updated
- Function swe_rise_trans_true_hor() added for Swiss Ephemeris 1.78
- several minor bug fixes (see documentation swephprg.pdf)

Updated on 23 April 2013, Swiss Ephemeris 1.79
- Improved precision in eclipse calculations: 2nd and 3rd contact with solar eclipses, penumbral and partial phases with lunar eclipses. 
- Bug fix in function swe_sol_eclipse_when_loc().If the local maximum eclipse occurs at sunset or sunrise, tret[0] now gives the moment when the lower limb of the Sun touches the horizon. This was not correctly implemented in former versions
- Bug fix in Perl functions swe_house() etc. These functions had crashed with a segmention violation if called with the house parameter ‘G’.
- Bug fix in Perl function swe_utc_to_jd(), where gregflag had been read from the 4th instead of the 6th parameter.
- Bug fix in Perl functions to do with date conversion. The default mechanism for gregflag was buggy.  
- For Hindu astrologers, some more ayanamshas were added that are related to Suryasiddhanta and Aryabhata and are of historical interest.
